# Python-Libraries
A list of the popular Python libraries.
Python Libraries are useful functions that eliminate the need for writing codes from scratch. Over 137,000 Python libraries are present today, and they play a vital role in developing machine learning, data science, data visualization, image and data manipulation applications, and more. Let us briefly introduce Python Programming Language and then directly dive into the most popular Python libraries. 
What is a Library?
A library is a collection of pre-combined codes that can be used iteratively to reduce the time required to code. They are handy for accessing the pre-written frequently used codes instead of writing them from scratch every single time. Similar to physical libraries, these are a collection of reusable resources, which means every library has a root source. This is the foundation behind the numerous open-source libraries available in Python.
